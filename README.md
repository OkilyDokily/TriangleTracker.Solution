## Description

_A page demonstrates basic C# with a console and MSTest._
_The page gets input from user and then tells them if they have a triangle_

                              |                                                 
## Setup/Installation Requirements

## Spec
| Spec | Input | Output |
|-|-|-|
| Make a triangletyper method | t.TriangleTyper() | "equilateral" |
| if any side is longer than the other two combined not a triangle | new Triangle(10,1,1).TriangleTyper() | "not a triangle" |
| if all sides are equal then we have and equilateral triangle | new Triangle(3,3,3).TriangleTyper() | "equilateral" |
| if two siders are equal then we have an isosolese triangle | new Triangle(2,2,3).TriangleTyper() | "isosolese" |
| otherwise we don't have a scalene triangle | new Triangle(2,3,4).TriangleTyper() | "scalene" |
